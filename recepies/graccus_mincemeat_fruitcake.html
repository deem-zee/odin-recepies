		<p>
			No treat that makes the rounds during the Feast of Winter Veil is quite so
			anticipated as Master Chef Graccu’s delicious fruitcake. Although this
			dessert is made with simple dried fruits, the spices from the mincemeat
			ramp up the flavor of the whole, while the brandy icing gives a nod to the
			traditional holiday treatment.

				3/4 cup buttermilk
			</li>
			<li>
				One 27-ounce jar of mincemeat (or one 8-ounce box)
			</li>
			<li>
				1/2 teaspoon baking soda
			</li>
			<li>
				2 teaspoons baking powder
			</li>
			<li>
				1/2 teaspoon salt
			</li>
			<li>
				3 cups flour
			</li>
			<li>
				1 cup dried currants
			</li>
			<li>
				3/4 cup diced candied ginger
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>BRANDY ICING</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				1 cup confectioners ’ sugar, sifted
			</li>
			<li>
				1 tablespoon orange zest
			</li>
			<li>
				Dash of vanilla
			</li>
			<li>
				1 to 2 tablespoons brandy
			</li>
			<li>
				About 10 maraschino cherries, halved, for garnish (optional)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Preheat the oven to 350 ° F, and lightly grease a Bundt pan.
			</li>
			<li>
				In a large bowl, beat together the butter, sugar, and zest until light and fluffy.
				Add the eggs one at a time, continuing to blend until fully incorporated. Add the
				buttermilk, followed by the mincemeat, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
				Gradually add the flour 1 cup at a time, mixing well. When the batter is smooth, fold
				in the currants and candied ginger, making sure they are evenly distributed throughout
				the mixture.
			</li>
			<li>
				Pour the batter into the greased pan and bake for an hour. Check to see if it is
				done by piercing with a toothpick; if the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is done.
				If not, return to oven and continue to bake for another 10 minutes, then check again.
				Repeat this until the cake is done. Allow the cake to cool for 10 minutes in the pan,
				then gently tip out onto a cooling rack. Let sit for another 30 minutes, or until it is
				cool to the touch, otherwise the icing will run off.
			</li>
			<li>
				In a small bowl, combine confectioners’ sugar, zest, vanilla, and brandy. Add
				enough milk to make a thick, pourable consistency. Carefully spoon over cake and
				garnish with maraschino cherries.
			</li>
