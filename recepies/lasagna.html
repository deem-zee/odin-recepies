		<h2>How to Make Beef Lasagna</h2>
		<p>Beef lasagna is a well-loved family meal all over the world and my version with a trio of cheeses,
			 béchamel and homemade tomato passata in a word is: SUBLIME.
			Between each moist layer of fresh egg pasta sheets is a mixture of veal and pork mince, smothered in sweet tomato sauce.
			There are two key things to make yours as good as mine – you need patience and quality ingredients,
			no shredded mozzarella or cheap passata here. No need to thank me,
			just make it, eat it and share it.</p>

			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<h3>MAKING THE SAUCE:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Beef lasagna recipe starts with the most important step – making the soffrito!
					This is the key to a tastier filling so add a generous amount of extra virgin olive oil to a large pot and let it slowly heat.
				</li>
				<li>
					Next, add the chopped up carrot, celery and onion and leave to cook for 5-10 minutes or until it has started to soften.
				</li>
				<li>
					Add the mincemeat to your pot and break it down using a wooden spoon while it starts to brown.
					Leave to simmer and stir every so often until it has started to brown.
				</li>
				<li>
					Once the mincemeat for your beef lasagna has browned, 
					add the glass of red wine and stir through with a wooden spoon. 
					Leave this to simmer until it evaporates remembering to stir every so often.
				</li>
				<li>
					Add 1 ½ bottles passata and stir through. Make sure the stove is on a medium-low heat, then cover the pot and let simmer for one hour.
				</li>
				<li>
					Go back to the pot every now and then and stir the sauce using a wooden spoon.
				</li>
				<li>
					After one hour, remove the lid and you will notice the tomato has reduced. 
					Add one glass of water at this point and let cook on a low heat. 
					Add more water if you believe it has dried up too much otherwise leave as it is.
				</li>
				<li>The sauce needs another hour to cook with the lid off. Remember to stir it!</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>HOW TO MAKE THE BECHAMEL SAUCE:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Next, the béchamel! Put the small saucepan on your stove at a low heat and add butter.
				</li>
				<li>
					Leave to melt slowly then add flour and quickly stir using a whisk. Keep doing this until the flour has disappeared.
				</li>
				<li>
					Slowly add the milk (around 1/4 at first) and don’t stop stirring! 
					Continue adding the milk and stirring – be gentle yet firm. 
					This will avoid it from sticking to the bottom and also from forming lumps.
				</li>
				<li>
					The sauce should start to become creamy and thick – stop once you have reached your desired consistency.
				</li>
				<li>
					Turn off the stove and add a sprinkle of salt and nutmeg.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>ASSEMBLING THE LASAGNA:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Line the baking tray with extra virgin olive oil or melted butter, using a pastry brush.
				</li>
				<li>
					Adjust the size of the lasagna sheets according to your dish so they fit nicely just by cutting them to size.
				</li>
				<li>
					Add a scoop of beef lasagna sauce to the bottom of the try and spread it all over, before laying down the first layer of lasagna sheets.
				</li>
				<li>
					Next scoop more sauce over the top of the pasta and spread it (using the bottom of a tablespoon or a wooden one) 
					before sprinkling pecorino/parmigiano cheese on top, then add provolone and fresh mozzarella (your desired amount).
				</li>
				<li>
					Add some béchamel – not too much and spread it slightly.
				</li>
				<li>
					Add another layer of pasta sheets then repeat step 17 until you create the number of layers you wish – I aim for 5-6!
				</li>
				<li>
					Add plain basil tomato sauce on top, spreading it all over, edge to edge and in each corner too.
				</li>
				<li>
					Cover the beef lasagna with foil and place in a pre-heated oven for 20 minutes at 180°C (fan forced).
				</li>
				<li>
					Remove from the oven and take the foil off, before adding a generous sprinkle (all over) of pecorino/parmigiano cheese.
				</li>
				<li>
					Bake in the oven again (no foil) for another 10 minutes then remove and let cool.
				</li>
				<li>
					Enjoy!
				</li>
